regime - denotes the intervention set with 0 for observation and >0 for interventions; [file name f"regime{self.i_dataset}.csv"]
         It is a list of datasest-id repeated for every data sample in that dataset;
         Example - consider observation data with 10 samples, intervention-set1 with 10 samples, intervention-set2 with 10 samples
         Regime will be [0]*10 [1]*10 [2]*10 - in reverse order


mask_intervention - denotes the intervened variable i.e. intervention targets; [file name f"intervention{self.i_dataset}.csv"]
         It is a list of intervention targets repeated for every data sample in that intervention-dataset;
         Example - consider observation data with 10 samples, intervention-set1 (target=2) with 10 samples, intervention-set2 (target=1) with 10 samples
         Mask will be [ ]*10 [2]*10 [1]*10 - in reverse order
         
intervention mask id var start from index 0
